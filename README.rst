The goal of sunkit-pyvista is to allow 3D visualization of solar physics data with pyvista.

Installation
============

See the `installation instructions <https://docs.sunpy.org/projects/sunkit-pyvista/en/latest/installing.html>`__ for more information.

Developing
==========

If you want to develop sunkit-pyvista you will need to install it from GitHub.
For detailed installation instructions, see `Development installation`_ in the sunpy docs.
These are for "sunpy" but the same works for sunkt-pyvista with a quick name substitution.

.. _Development installation:  https://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/dev_guide/contents/newcomers.html#setting-up-a-development-environment

Running Figure tests
--------------------

You need to use your local environment and make sure its up to date.
This does not with tox for now.

2 command line arguments can be passed to pytest:

* ``update_image_cache`` : Resets the ``image_cache`` directory with new figures generated from your local environment.
* ``ignore_image_cache`` : Ignores the image cache and will not perform any image comparison.

Example usage:

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest -s -vvv --update_image_cache sunkit_pyvista/
