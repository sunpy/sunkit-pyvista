Installing
==========
``sunkit-pyvista`` requires Python 3.8 or 3.9. Earlier versions may work, but
are not supported. Python 3.10 is not yet supported because VTK doesn't (yet)
provide a built package for Python 3.10.

To install via. pip use::

  python -m pip install sunkit-pyvista

This will install ``sunkit-pyvista`` and all the dependencies it needs.
