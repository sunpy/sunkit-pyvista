Example Gallery
***************

The gallery contains examples of how to use ``sunkit-pyvista``.
Each example is a short and self contained how-to guide for performing a specific task.

Unfortunately, the gallery is not interactive on readthedocs.
If you run these locally, you can interact with the plots.
