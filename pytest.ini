markers =
    mpl_image_compare: marks this test function as using hash-based Matplotlib figure verification. This mark is not meant to be directly applied, but is instead automatically applied when a test function uses the @sunkit_pyvista.tests.helpers.figure_test decorator.
    display_server: marks this test function as needing a display server.
